# Typescript-Master-Class
-----
## Dedicated to my very first contact with Typescript based on RocketSeat's master class

### Basic application with TypeScript

 - After clonning run `yarn` to get libs and dependencies 
 - Once in *backend*, run `node dist/index.js` to set the service up
 - Last, in *front*, run `yarn start` to run client

The main focus here is to start having an understanding of the way *types* works on React projects and how to use them (:
